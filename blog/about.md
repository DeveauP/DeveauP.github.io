Some information about you!

### More Information

I am a 2nd year PhD student in bioinformatics, working on clonal evolution in neuroblastoma, under the supervision of Olivier DELATTRE and Gudrun SCHLEIERMACHER at U830 and Valentina BOEVA at U900.
              I graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique in 2014, and obtained a master's degree in Molecular and Cellular Biotherapies from Université Paris Descartes the same year.
			  I have always enjoyed interdisciplinary work, which lead me to different topics such as quality control for <a href="http://fr.simone-perele.com/" >Simone PERELE </a>,
        <a href="http://www.gendarmerie.interieur.gouv.fr/cegn/Autres-pages/Centres/Centre-national-d-instruction-nautique-de-la-gendarmerie-CNING" > scuba-diving gear handling </a>,
			  <a href="http://www.stowers.org/" > DNA recombination in the middle of Missouri </a>, <a href="https://www.hgid.org/">Human genetics in immunology</a>,
        and finally <a href="http://curie.fr/">programming and data analysis </a>
              After some work in experimental biology at Stowers's Institute and Imagine Institute, I switched to the world of computer sciences.

                However, I did not forget all of my previous work, and put it to good use, by teaching molecular and cellular biology at Université Paris Sud (1st year of Bachelor degree).
