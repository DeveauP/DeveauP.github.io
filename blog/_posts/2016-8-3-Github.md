# Github? Why?

Github is an amazing code sharing website - and I do not only say that because this page is hosted by them.

<!--more-->

It allows to look at source code, post issues, have feedback on your work, keep track of changes (this is the purpose of any subversion - or SVN).

It also allows virtually anyone to work on your code, make improvements and submit them - with approval of the owner. It is also extremely powerful when linked
to Travis-CI (we'll get there after) to check if your code is behaving properly.

 However, getting started with Github is not always even if some tutorials exist <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/"> here </a> or
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/"> here </a>.

### Commands

There are few commands to know : add,commit,push and pull. This is what you will do most of the time.

## Creating a repository
One of the first things to do is to create a repository, and (unfortunately) it is one of the most challenging tasks also!
Once on the homepage, you can click on new repository:

You should get to this page:

To be guided by Github, you should untick "Initialize repository with a readme", as it will give you a list of way to start your repository.
With Windows, the fastest is to initialize with the desktop, on Unix, you can paste the commands given, we'll explain it after. 
For the next few lines, I'll assume that you are in a directory where all the code you want to update is stored.
 
{% highlight bash %}
echo "# test" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/Username/Repo.git
git push -u origin master
{% endhighlight %}

Let's go through:
{% highlight bash %}
echo "# test" >> README.md
{% endhighlight %}
Appends (creates if the file doesn't exist) a README.md file chich contains: # test
{% highlight bash %}
git init
{% endhighlight %}
Creates an empty .git directory, that is used to track the changes (in fact it tracks the files like [snapshots](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics), whereas other SVN usually track differences).
 {% highlight bash %}
git add README.md
{% endhighlight %}
Tells git you want to add this file to your next commit (= the next update you will make). If you wanted to added all files to your next commit you can run:
{% highlight bash %}
git add .
{% endhighlight %}

Finally we are there! Your first commit:
{% highlight bash %}
git commit -m "Your first commit, a readme"
{% endhighlight %}

Note that typing ```git commit``` will open vim text editor so that you can write the text of your commit inside. 
A good commit text explains what are the updates (so that you don't have to through the code all over again!)

The next step will link the folder on Github servers and your local directory:
{% highlight bash %}
git remote add origin https://github.com/Username/Repo.git
{% endhighlight %}

Finally you want to make the changes publish, i.e. push them on Github's servers:
{% highlight bash %}
git push -u origin master
{% endhighlight %}

You may have to sign in at this point: unless you change parameters, you are the only one to make or accept changes in your online repository.

## Second commit

Now that everything works, we'll see how to make a second commit (and the same will work for the rest of the time):
{% highlight bash %}
echo "I'm expanding the readme!" >> README.md
git .
git commit -m "Readme expanded"
git push
{% endhighlight %}

As simple as that!

## What if I made changes on-line?

Remember when I said that the four commands were add, commit, push, pull? And we didn't use pull yet...
If changes are made on the on-line repository, and you want (have to) make them effective in your local directory, nothing so simple:
{% highlight bash %}
cd /path/to/repo
git pull
{% endhighlight %}

That's it!

# Travis who?

As I started to explain at the beginning, it can be useful to check that your code always behaves in a proper way. 
Imagine that your package computes mean of a vector, but for debugging you assigned the value of the result, and never changed it back. Unless you test all functions every time you make
a change in your package, this could go unnoticed. This can happen even more frequently when you are not the only one to work on your package!
That's where [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) steps in.

## Setting up Travis

When you go to [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) you can directly log in with your Github account ( Yay! )
In the top right corner you have your initials, clicking on it will take you to your profile - and the list of your github repositories. Activating one will not be very useful, because Travis will not know what to.

I'll just explain how to make it work with R packages here, but you can have a look at [all of these languages](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started) .

### Adding a yaml config file

We are going to create a ```.travis.yml``` file:

{% highlight yml %}
language: R
sudo: false
cache: packages
r:
  - oldrel
  - release
  - devel
warnings_are_errors: false

r_github_packages:
  - jimhester/covr

after_success:
- Rscript -e 'covr::codecov()'
```

This config file says that the language of the repository is in R, that it should test old, current and devel versions of R, and that warnings should not be counted as error. Then after check, if everything 
is successful, it should use the ```codecov``` function from ```covr``` package.

Basically, Travis will do here is check that your package is properly written, with documentation, etc. Just as would ```devtools::check()``` would, but here the results of the checking are public.

### What about unit testing?

If you want to have a look at tests run on Travis that are much more comprehensive, I recommend the .yml from [xgboost package](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost)

### I want to have a pill in my readme too!

Your build is passing, and you want to tell the world - and you should! You can add a "pill" to your readme saying just that, with 
[ [ Build Status ] (https://travis-ci.org/Username/Repo.svg?branch=master ) ] ( https://travis-ci.org/Username/Repo )
Now you have a pill automatically updated giving the status of the current build (+/- checking time), and on clicking the pill it gets you to the log of the checking. How awesome is that?

I guess you could say it's : [awesome pill](https://img.shields.io/badge/Awesome-Approved-brightgreen.svg)

### What can I do next?

If you want to learn more on continuous integration, you can have a look at unit tests. The next blog post will be on ```ggplot```.
