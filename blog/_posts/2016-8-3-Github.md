# Github? Why?

Github is an amazing code sharing website - and I do not only say that because this page is hosted by them.

<!--more-->

It allows to look at source code, post issues, have feedback on your work, keep track of changes (this is the purpose of any subversion - or SVN).

It also allows virtually anyone to work on your code, make improvements and submit them - with approval of the owner. It is also extremely powerful when linked
to Travis-CI (we'll get there after) to check if your code is behaving properly.

 However, getting started with Github is not always even if some tutorials exist <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/"> here </a> or
					<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/"> here </a>.
### Commands
There are few commands to know : add,commit,push and pull. This is what you will do most of the time.

## Creating a repository
One of the first things to do is to create a repository, and (unfortunately) it is one of the most challenging tasks also!
Once on the homepage, you can click on new repository:

You should get to this page:

To be guided by Github, you should untick "Initialize repository with a readme", as it will give you a list of way to start your repository.
With Windows, the fastest is to initialize with the desktop, on unix, you can paste the commands given, we'll explain it after:

{% highlight bash %}
    echo "# test" >> README.md
	git init
	git add README.md
	git commit -m "first commit"
	git remote add origin https://github.com/DeveauP/test.git
	git push -u origin master
{% endhighlight %}
