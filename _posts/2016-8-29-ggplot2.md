# ggplot2
[
Let's face it, I am addicted to R, and this is partly (mostly) due to ggplot and Rstudio. <!--more-->
If you need an introduction to R, [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming) is a good place to start, as well as [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/). 
Of course will be small compared to the [documentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/index.html) or [the book](http://ggplot2.org/book/), but I'll make it enough to get you started. 

## Generating data

Thanks to what I learnt on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5963610/5779570), I'm making sure that what I'm doing is reproducible - it's always annoying to see a beautiful example that doesn't work when you try to reproduce.
So we'll generate data for this (who said [mtcars](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html)?)

{% highlight R %}
set.seed(123)
dataset<-data.frame(A = sample(x = 1:10, size = 1000, replace = TRUE),
					B = sample(x = LETTERS[1:5], size = 1000, replace = TRUE),
					C = rnorm(n = 1000,mean = 0, sd = 1)
					)
dataset$D<-rnorm(n=1000, mean = dataset$C,sd = 1)
{% endhighlight %}

We thus have a dataframe with four columns, A contains integer, B has letters, C and D have numeric values.

## plot vs qplot vs ggplot: non-standard evaluation

What is non-standard evaluation? This is the fact that the arguments passed to the aesthetics will not be evaluated, but will be used to call columns. 
For people used to the `plot` syntax, it can be disturbing at first, as you should not give vectors as input - we'll see a workaround to that after.
Let's make this clear with an example of plot, qplot and ggplot:

{% highlight R %}
plot(x= dataset$A, y = dataset$C)
{% endhighlight %}
![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/first_plot.png)

{% highlight R %}
qplot(x= dataset$C, y= dataset$D)
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight R %}
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,y=D))+geom_point()
{% endhighlight %}

Notice:

	1. We never explicitely provided the vector in the `ggplot` syntax yet we have the same output as the `qplot`. 
	The same syntax is used in `plyr` or `dplyr` (we'll talk about these another time). 
	2. The `ggplot` creates an object where characteristics are linked to values, you then have to use to combine this object with a representation `geom_point`
	in our case to get a plot! Think of it as an instruction of what you would like to plot.

This is what you should see:

It doesn't look too good but we'll make it better.

## Editing your plot: basic operations

### Changing the theme

By default, the background of `ggplot` is grey to have a better experience on screens. However, for printing, or by habits, it can be useful to have a black and white theme,
or edit the axes. This is feasible with `theme()`, but some themes are already available with `ggplot2`, such as `theme_bw`, `theme_classic`, or `theme_minimal`.
{% highlight R %}
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,y=D))+geom_point()+theme_bw()
{% endhighlight %}
![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/theme_bw.png )


{% highlight R %}
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,y=D))+geom_point()+theme_classic()
{% endhighlight %}
![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/theme_classic.png )


{% highlight R %}
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,y=D))+geom_point()+theme_minimal()
{% endhighlight %}
![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/theme_minimal.png )

Often, where labels on the axes are quite large, it can be useful to turn them. This is also an operation handled in theme. We'll keep the black & white theme, and add a 45Â° shift
to the x axis and make it bigger:

{% highlight R %}
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,y=D))+geom_point()+theme_bw()+
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,size = 16))+
  xlab("X axis")+ylab("Y axis")
{% endhighlight %}
![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/theme_bw_shifted.png )

Notice how you can also change the labels of the axes with `xlab` and `ylab`.
You don't remember if it is `x.ticks.axis` or `x.axis.ticks` to change the ticks in your theme? Don't worry, everything is listed [here](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/theme.html)
(It is `axis.ticks.x` )

### Adding color and editing legend

Now that we have a theme, we will color the points based on values from column A.
{% highlight R %}
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,y=D,color = A))+geom_point()+theme_bw()
{% endhighlight %}
![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/geom_point_colored.png )

We have a gradient of colors, but our data is integer? `ggplot` assumes that numerical data are continuous, so the best way to represent these is a gradient. To change that, 
you need to make this data a factor or a character. Otherwise you will get an error message:

 > Error: Continuous value supplied to discrete scale

{% highlight R %}
dataset$A<-as.character(dataset$A)
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,y=D,color = A))+geom_point()+theme_bw()+
			scale_color_discrete("This is \n a legend")
{% endhighlight %}
![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/geom_point_colored_discrete.png )

I also provided the name of the legend for colors in the `scale_color_discrete`, but this legend is ordered in alphabetical order... It would be better in numerical order:

{% highlight R %}
dataset$A<-factor(dataset$A,levels  = 
				unique(dataset$A)[order(as.numeric(unique(dataset$A)))])
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,y=D,color = A))+geom_point()+theme_bw()+
			scale_color_discrete("This is \n a legend")
{% endhighlight %}
![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/geom_point_colored_reordered.png )

We'll also add shapes to this plot:

{% highlight R %}
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,y=D,color = A,shape = B))+geom_point()+theme_bw()+
			scale_color_discrete("This is \n a legend")+scale_shape_discrete("Shape legend")
{% endhighlight %}
![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/geom_point_colored_shaped.png )

### Adding lines

What happens if we try to connect the previous points?
{% highlight R %}
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,y=D,color = A))+geom_line()+theme_bw()+
			scale_color_discrete("This is \n a legend")
{% endhighlight %}
![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/geom_line_test.png )

Let's make it a bit more transparent so that we can see better:
{% highlight R %}
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,y=D,color = A))+geom_line(alpha = I(0.5))+theme_bw()+
			scale_color_discrete("This is \n a legend")
{% endhighlight %}
![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/geom_line_alpha.png )

The `I` function tells `ggplot` that 0.5 is a numeric value of transparency, and not a value to group different lines.
You can now see that each color has its own line! This is because `ggplot` has grouped the points by values of the color, shape, etc.
It is useful to remember this when you want to have a single line with multiple colors.  

### Adding a trend

Now we know how to make a line, but we'd like a trend for all points and one trend for each color. We'll try using `geom_smooth`:

{% highlight R %}
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,y=D,color = A))+geom_smooth(alpha = I(0.3))+geom_point()+theme_bw()+
  scale_color_discrete("This is \n a legend")
{% endhighlight %}
![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/geom_smooth_each.png )
 
Not very useful to have a trend for each class, is it? Remember, we have grouped everything because of the color in `ggplot`, so if I remove it, and only use it
as an argument in `geom_point` what happens?
{% highlight R %}
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,y=D))+geom_smooth(alpha = I(0.3))+geom_point(aes(color = A))+theme_bw()+
  scale_color_discrete("This is \n a legend")
{% endhighlight %}
![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/geom_smooth_all.png )

The trend has been calculated on the whole dataset, and we still have our points shown with different colors!
 
### Showing density

We have shown the trend of points, but sometimes it can be more useful to show a density of points, either one or two-dimensional.
Here we will show for 2D density, but the same works with `geom_density`. We also increase the transparency of points in our plot:

{% highlight R %}
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,y=D))+geom_density_2d()+geom_point(aes(color = A),alpha = I(0.3))+theme_bw()+
  scale_color_discrete("This is \n a legend")
{% endhighlight %}
![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/geom_density.png )

You now know a lot in making plots with `ggplot2`. One last useful thing is to apply what we have seen with histograms.

## Making an histogram

An histogram shows the number of values that fall into a bin, for example in the sequence {0,1,5,7,2,10}, 3 values fall in [0;2].

We are going to make an histogram of our data with 50 bins:

{% highlight R %}
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C))+geom_histogram(bins = 50)+theme_bw()
{% endhighlight %}
 ![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/first_hist.png )
 
### Editing the histogram

How do we add color to this plot? With with the color argument again?

{% highlight R %}
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,color = B))+geom_histogram(bins = 50)+theme_bw()
{% endhighlight %}
 ![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/color_hist_ggplot.png )
 
 As you can see, only the edge of the bars have been colored. This is because areas have a `fill` argument.
 
 {% highlight R %}
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,fill = B))+geom_histogram(bins = 50)+theme_bw()+
  scale_fill_discrete("This is \n a fill ")

{% endhighlight %}
 ![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/fill_hist_ggplot.png )
 
 And now we will add a density, just to remember what a gaussian distribution looks like!
 
  {% highlight R %}
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,fill = B))+geom_histogram(bins = 50)+theme_bw()+
  scale_fill_discrete("This is \n a fill ")

{% endhighlight %}
 ![alt ](http://deveaup.github.io/images/gaussian.png )

 ## Saving your file
 
 You can save your file with `ggsave` now:
{% highlight R %}
ggsave("gaussian.png")
{% endhighlight %}

or 
{% highlight R %}
my_ggplot<-ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x=C,fill = B))+geom_histogram(bins = 50)+theme_bw()+
  scale_fill_discrete("This is \n a fill ")
ggsave(filename = "gaussian.pdf,plot = my_ggplot)
{% endhighlight %}


Note that ggsave automatically saves the last plot unless you specify otherwise, and will produce an image with format depending on the name of your extension (".png", ".pdf",".jpg")

## What's next? 
 
 This closes this introduction to `ggplot2`. Of course there are many more things to cover, such as `scales`, long vs short data formatting and transitions with `reshape2`, 
 heatmaps and multiple plots (with `gridExtra` or `facet`), so I'll make more posts on these.
