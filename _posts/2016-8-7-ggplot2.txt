#ggplot2

Let's face it, I am addicted to R, and this is partly (mostly) due to ggplot and Rstudio. <!--more-->
If you need an introduction to R, [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming) is a good place to start, as well as [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/). 
Of course will be small compared to the [documentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/index.html) or [the book](http://ggplot2.org/book/), but I'll make it enough to get you started. 

## Generating data

Thanks to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5963610/5779570), I'm making sure that what I'm doing is reproducible - it's always annoying to see a beautiful example that doesn't work when you try to reproduce.
So we'll generate data for this (who said [mtcars](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html)?)

{% highlight R %}
set.seed(123)
dataset<-data.frame(A = sample(x = 1:10, size = 1000, replace = TRUE),
					B = sample(x = LETTERS[1:10], size = 1000, replace = TRUE),
					C = rnorm(n = 1000,mean = 0, sd = 1)
					D = as.factor(sample(x = 1:10, size = 1000, replace = TRUE))
					)
{% endhighlight %}

We thus have a dataframe with four columns, one that contains integer, one that has letters, the third has numeric values, and the last is made of factors.
