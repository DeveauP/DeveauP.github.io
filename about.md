I am a 2nd year PhD student in bioinformatics, working on clonal evolution in neuroblastoma, under the supervision of Olivier DELATTRE and Gudrun SCHLEIERMACHER at U830 and Valentina BOEVA at U900.
I graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique in 2014, and obtained a master's degree in Molecular and Cellular Biotherapies from Université Paris Descartes the same year.

I have always enjoyed interdisciplinary work, which lead me to different topics such as quality control for <a href="http://fr.simone-perele.com/" >Simone PERELE </a>,
<a href="http://www.gendarmerie.interieur.gouv.fr/cegn/Autres-pages/Centres/Centre-national-d-instruction-nautique-de-la-gendarmerie-CNING" > scuba-diving gear handling </a>,
<a href="http://www.stowers.org/" > DNA recombination in the middle of Missouri </a>, <a href="https://www.hgid.org/">Human genetics in immunology</a>,
and finally <a href="http://curie.fr/">programming and data analysis </a>

After some work in experimental biology at Stowers's Institute and Imagine Institute, I switched to the world of computer sciences and machine learning.
            
However, I did not forget all of my previous work, and put it to good use, by teaching molecular and cellular biology at Université Paris Sud (first and secong year of Bachelor degree).
